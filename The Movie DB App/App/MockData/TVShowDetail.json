Most empires—real and imagined—crumble from such heights. In the case of the Targaryens, their slow fall begins almost 193 years before the events of Game of Thrones, when King Viserys Targaryen breaks with a century of tradition by naming his daughter Rhaenyra heir to the Iron Throne. But when Viserys later fathers a son, the court is shocked when Rhaenyra retains her status as his heir, and seeds of division sow friction across the realm.","popularity":5173.728,"poster_path":"/z2yahl2uefxDCl0nogcRBstwruJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3268,"logo_path":"/tuomPhY2UtuPTqqFnKMVHvSb724.png","name":"HBO","origin_country":"US"},{"id":180956,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bastard Sword","origin_country":"US"},{"id":180957,"logo_path":null,"name":"1:26 Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":180958,"logo_path":null,"name":"GRRM","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2022-08-21","episode_count":10,"id":134965,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/z2yahl2uefxDCl0nogcRBstwruJ.jpg","season_number":1}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Returning Series","tagline":"Fire and blood.","type":"Scripted","vote_average":8.815,"vote_count":747}
